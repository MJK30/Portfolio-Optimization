# ðŸ“ˆ Portfolio Optimization using Modern Portfolio Theory

This project implements a portfolio optimization tool using Modern Portfolio Theory (Markowitz framework). It uses historical stock data to compute optimal asset allocations based on expected returns and risk, helping investors build a risk-adjusted, diversified portfolio.

## Project Highlights

- Fetches real-time stock data using Yahoo Finance
- Calculates expected returns, volatility, and Sharpe ratio
- Solves for optimal asset weights using convex optimization (`cvxpy`)
- Visualizes allocations and the efficient frontier
- Compares performance against equal-weighted portfolio baseline
